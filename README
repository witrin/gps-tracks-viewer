# GPS Tracks Viewer

A simple GPS tracks viewer using:

 - ECMAScript 2015 (http://ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/)
 - Custom elements (https://w3.org/TR/custom-elements/)
 - Google Maps API (https://developers.google.com/maps/)

## Build

To build the viewer you need to run `npm install` once. The following build
scripts are available and require a Bash 3+:

  - `build` - Builds a release version into the *target directory*.
  - `watch` - Builds continuously a debug version into the *target directory*.
  - `debug` - Builds a debug version into the *target directory*.
  - `lint` - Lints the sources using *eslint* (http://eslint.org/).
  - `start` - Starts a local web server for the viewer using the *target port*.
  - `stop` - Stops a started web server.
  - `clean` - Cleans the latest build.

The *target directory* is per default `dist`. Use the package configuration 
setting `target.folder` to change it. The *target port* is per default `8080`.
Use the package configuration setting `target.port` to change it. See also 
https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/config how to change the package configuration.

## Usage

The viewer requires a REST API for the GPS tracks, which is not part of this
package. To configure the viewer use the `configuration.json` within its root
folder. There is a `configuration.example.json` as a template. For more details
about the REST API see `src/services/tracks/index.js`.

## Architecture

The main application can be found in `src/app/index.js`. It is started by the
bootstrap script within `src/boot.js`. The UI components are provided with 
`src/elements` and directly used by the main application. The services within
`src/services` provide access to the GPS tracks, the application configuration
and the Google Maps API. The main application template is in `src/index.html`.
